# WK2HW-Gove-Portfolio

## Description

I have designed the start of my coding portfolio. The purpose is to showcase what skills I have learned to employers. Portfolio's are a potential employers source to see my work and show my thoughts behind the processes.

We have touched on flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
