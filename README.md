# WK2HW-Gove-Portfolio

## Description

I have designed the start of my coding portfolio. The purpose is to showcase what skills I have learned to employers. Portfolio's are a potential employers source to see my work and show my thoughts behind the processes.

We have touched on flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

## Usage

This website will allow you to link to my work as well as provide contact details.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    img src="./Assests/Images/Screenshot-of-Portfolio-Page.png" alt="Image of Landing Page"assets/images/screenshot.png"
